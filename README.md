# Wine Cultivar Classification Project

## Overview
This project focuses on predicting the cultivar of wine using various classification models. The dataset, derived from the UCI dataset library, includes 16 attributes measured across 182 wine samples.

## Dataset
The Wine dataset includes chemical analysis results of wines grown in the same region in Italy but derived from three different cultivars.

## Methodology
- **Data Exploration and Cleaning:** Initial data analysis and preprocessing.
- **Clustering:** Using K-means to identify potential groupings.
- **Classification Models:** SVM (Support Vector Machine) and KKNN (k-nearest neighbors).
- **Evaluation:** ROC curve metrics for model performance assessment.

## Key Technologies
- R Studio
- ggplot2 for data visualization
- PCA (Principal Component Analysis)

## Results
The project includes a comprehensive comparison and evaluation of SVM and KKNN models based on their performance in classifying wine cultivars.

## How to Run
Instructions on setting up the environment, loading the dataset, and executing the analysis scripts.
